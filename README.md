Design and interpret a multiple linear regression analysis to identify variables of interest.
Calculate summary statistics for quantitative variables.
Perform a t-test in R and provide interpretation of results.
Design your own statistical study to compare vehicle performance of two vehicles.

By combining my understanding of R and statistics with the manufacturing datasets provided, I have generated a robust technical report and attempted to design my own study.
