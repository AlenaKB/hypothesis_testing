# Hypothesis Testing with R

## Project Objective
Design and interpret a multiple linear regression analysis to identify variables of interest.
Calculate summary statistics for quantitative variables.
Perform a t-test in R and provide interpretation of results.
Design your own statistical study to compare vehicle performance of two vehicles.

### Methods Used
- Descriptive Statistics
- Statistical testing

### Technologies 
- R

## Project Description
By combining my understanding of R and statistics with the manufacturing datasets provided, I have generated a robust technical report and attempted to design my own study that compares the performance of the MechaCar prototype vehicle to other comparable vehicles on the market.
I determined what question I would ask, what the null and alternative hypothesis would be to answer that question, and what statistical test could be used to test this hypothesi, knowing what test should be used, what data should be collected.
